The Andover Entrepreneurship Forum - Reinventing Education
====================
Do you have an idea to change education at AHS? Make it a reality! The Andover Entrepreneurship Forum is a competition to reinvent education.

##Our Mission
We strive to encourage and inspire entrepreneurship by providing a platform on which students may question the world around them. We prepare students to make a difference by giving them the skills they need to address real-world problems through research, planning, and communication.

## Your Mission
Two words: Reinvent Education. Our society, technology, and ideas have changed immensely over the past centuries. Itâ€™s time that our education does, too. Making a difference begins with an idea, and there is no better time to start than now.

## Process
We encourage utilizing Design Thinking - a solution-based approach to solving problems.
1. Think - What problem do you want to solve?
2. Plan - Sketch and plan your solution
3. Prototype - Create a prototype
4. Present - Pitch your idea
