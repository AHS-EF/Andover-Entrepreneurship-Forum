                    <p>Design Thinking is a way to think about and solve problems. Most Design Thinkers refer to the 5 Stages of Design Thinking by Stanford’s d.school: <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-1-in-the-design-thinking-process-empathise-with-your-users" target="_blank">Empathize</a>, <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-2-in-the-design-thinking-process-define-the-problem-and-interpret-the-results" target="_blank">Define (the problem)</a>, <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-3-in-the-design-thinking-process-ideate" target="_blank">Ideate</a>, <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-4-in-the-design-thinking-process-prototype" target="_blank">Prototype</a> and <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-5-in-the-design-thinking-process-test" target="_blank">Test</a>. AEF will utilize simplifed version of this model called HCD - Human Centered Design, developed by the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-thinking-a-quick-overview" target="_blank">Interaction Design Foundation</a>. The following represents the <strong>H: Hear</strong> phase of the HCD model.</p>

                    <p>The Hear stage is about developing a deeper understanding of the people you are designing for (empathy) and defining the problem that the team is trying to solve.  In essence, this is a specific form of market research where you are trying to uncover “diamonds” and “nuggets” of unique information about your target market.</p> 

                    <h3 id="empathize-nav" class="modal-heading">Empathize</h3>

                    <p>Designing an effective and appealing product starts with a deeper understanding of the people you are designing for. That means gaining <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/stage-1-in-the-design-thinking-process-empathise-with-your-users" target="_blank">empathy</a> for that person - the ability to understand and share the feelings of that person.</p>

                    <p>Your goal is to gain insights into your target user by understanding their needs, thoughts, emotions and motivations. The good news is that you have a wide range of methods at your command for learning more about people:</p>

                                    <p>For you to truly empathize with target users, you should try to adopt the mindset of a beginner. Why assume a beginner's mindset?</p>
                                    <p>We humans all have our own assumptions and beliefs that we carry around, every day. Your life experiences sculpt your beliefs and assumptions and helps you to make sense of the world. However, this affects your ability to empathize with the people we observe.</p>
                                    <p>To empathize do your best to leave your own assumptions and experiences behind when making observations.  Below are some tips on how to assume a beginner’s mindset from <a href="https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/groups/k12/wiki/4e22d/Beginners_mind.html" target="_blank">Stanford’s d.school:</a></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Don’t judge</strong>. Just observe and engage users without the influence of value judgments upon their actions, circumstances, decisions, or “issues.”</li>
                                        <li><strong>Question everything</strong>. Even (and especially) the things you think you already understand. Ask questions to learn about how the user perceives the world. Think about a 5-year-old who asks “Why?” a hundred times.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Be truly curious</strong>. Strive to assume a posture of wonder and curiosity, especially in circumstances that seem either familiar or frightening.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Find patterns</strong>. Look for interesting threads and themes that emerge across interactions with users.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Listen</strong>. Really. Lose your agenda and let the scene soak into your psyche. Absorb what users say to you, and how they say it, without thinking about the next thing you’re going to say.</li>
                                    </ul>

                        <!-- INTERVIEW -->
                        <div class="tab-pane" id="interview">
                            <div class="panel panel-default">

                                    <p>Empathy interviews are the cornerstone of Design Thinking. Interviews are a great way to understand another person’s thoughts, feelings, needs, and goals. This will give you insights into the choices that person makes, their behavioral traits, and ultimately you can identify a person’s needs to help innovate, and create products or services for that person. Below are some steps to help you with your interview:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Identify and recruit (extreme) users  to interview</strong>. First of all, your target users will primarily be Andover High School students. Design Thinkers recommend that you pay particular attention to “extreme” target users. Why? Extreme users tend to magnify the issues of the main  group and usually have unique insights into the problem that allow you to explore beyond the obvious solutions. These could be students that have the most to say about education-related topics. You are also welcome to interview users in the “middle” or “average”. Your goal is to develop solutions for the main target group (not just extreme users). <a href="https://medium.com/@StaceyDyer/design-thinking-what-is-an-empathy-interview-25f71bd496d7" target="_blank">Experts recommend interviewing 5 people</a>; you should plan on interviewing at least 2 people.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Prepare your interview questions</strong>. Your goal is to have a meaningful, empathic conversation with a person that will help you learn more about the challenge at-hand (education). Before you ask specific questions, introduce yourself and your project and ask permission to record the interview. Let them know that their name will not be used. Then shift the focus to the person by asking them their name, grade, where they live and perhaps what activities they are involved in. Below are some tips:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Keep questions to 10 words or less</li>
                                                <li>Get specific stories, ask about specific instances (“Tell me about the last time…”)</li>
                                                <li>Never stop asking “why?”</li>
                                                <li>Explore emotions like “Why do you feel that way?”</li>
                                                <li>Observe non-verbal cues (use of hands, facial expressions)</li> 
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Have a Beginner’s Mindset</strong>. Before conducting and interview it is important to adopt a Beginner’s Mindset. It is also critical that you talk with your target users with genuine empathy. In other words, “keep it real.” Think about it… would you share your needs and goals with someone if you thought they were being fake? You want the person you are talking to feel like they are be heard.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Be an active listener</strong>. According to one study, being an active listener is being a “trampoline listener”. The theory, as described by a <a href="https://www.pointforward.com/approach/" target="_blank">leading consumer research firm</a>, is that “the best listeners are like trampolines - amplifying, energizing and clarify what is said.” This idea came from a study that concluded that active listening boils down to three things:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Don’t talk when others are speaking</li>
                                                <li>Let the person know you are listening through facial expressions and verbal sounds (“Mmm-hmm”)</li>
                                                <li>Repeat what others have said (like a trampoline), practically word-for-word</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Make the person feel comfortable</strong>. If you expect someone to share their feelings with you, they need to feel comfortable. Meet the target user in a place that is familiar to them. Given our target users are Andover High School students, you could pick a place at AHS (like the library) or meet them somewhere else where they are comfortable.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Silence your devices</strong>. You want to be full present during your interview. If you start texting during your conversation, the person being interviewed could feel slighted or less important. Make the person feel and know that they have your undivided attention.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Interview in pairs</strong>. By interviewing in pairs, one person can focus on data collection, recording and technicalities while the other can focus on the person they are interviewing.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Record your interview</strong>. By recording your interview you ensure that you won’t miss anything. You can also document that you have permission to use the data. You will not be able to see non-verbal cues but that can be noted during the interview.
                                        </li>     
                                    </ol>
                                </div>

                    <p>A great definition of your problem will be able to guide you and give you a clearer, more focused approach to the next stages</p>

                    <p>During your research, you might uncover some insights and problems, however, it is critical to "frame the right problem to create the right solution."</p>

                    <p>To interpret results, use methods like space saturating, empathy mapping, and why-how laddering: </p>

                            <strong>Space saturating</strong>, or grouping, is exactly what it sounds like: saturate a space. Bring all your findings into one place to create a collage of interviews and ideas. From there, it will be easier to draw connections between the individual observations and help to both develop deeper insights and define the problem(s).

                    <p>Once you develop a clear and specific problem statement, it is time to brainstorm ideas.<p>
                    <p>There are hundreds of brainstorming or <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ideation" target="_blank">ideation</a> techniques. One we use at AHS is to sketch out as many ideas as possible within a certain timeframe, perhaps 5 minutes.</p>
                    <p>The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible, to come up with a "range of possibilities."</p>
                    <p>If you are working on teams, you can do this exercise on your own then share and merge your ideas until you come up with one grand solution.</p>
                    <p>And that is the end-goal of the PLAN phase, brainstorm from your problem statement until you come up with one unique and specific idea.</p>
